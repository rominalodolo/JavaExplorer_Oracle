## Overview 

- Title and Objectives 
Welcome from the Lecturer 
To become familiar as to why Java was invented 
The structure of a java program 
Explore the java design mindset 
Common Java API's 
The use of java in the enterprise 

- Java Origins and Ecosystem
A member os C-like family 
Designed for consumer electronics 
Phones to super computers 

Ecosystem: Java Card, ME micro- Eition, SE Standard edition, MP Micro-Profile, EE Enterprise-Edition.

Cross-platform: Java program only needs to be written and compiled once 
No platform-specific changes has to be applied to the source code. 
A single, compiled version of a program can run on any platform. ie. MAC to Windows 
Java programs are executed within a java virtual machine (JVM)


- Java Language 

Code structure: 
Class: - basic units of code - describe data and logic of your program 
Package: - Intermediate logical code aggregation - Group of classes 
Module: - High-level physical code aggregation - Groups of packages

Java syntax - Java code is grouped into classes , classes contain methods and variables that fulfill their purpose 

Exception handeling - interrupt normal program execution when problems occur, decide what your program should do in case of an error 


- Java Design 
Classes: attributes and behavior  
Objects: an instance - a specific eg of a class 

Recuing code through inheritence - inherit(reuse) attributes and behaviors across the hierarchy., top-level classes contain generic code reused by their decendants 

"Java has other ways to achieve a flexible design, like interfaces that abstract out common behavior across classes, enumerations, called enums, for creating user-defined constants, and generics to pass specific type information to the compiler, making programs more stable and less error-prone."

Analysis, Design, and Architecture 
UML - Unified modelling language 
Analyze business requirements 
Model code structure 
Describe application deployment 

- Java API's 
Java Arrays and collections 
An array is a simple group of elements, the collection API provides more flexible capabilities for managing group of objects

- Java in the Enterprise 
Expose code to the enterprise for reuse in a controlled, standardized manner. like SOAP and REST 

JAXB and JAXP API's enable object mappings, marshaling, unmarshaling 

JSONP API enables JSON object mappings, marshaling and unmarshaling 

JAX-WS API enables SOAP Servive impementation

JAX-RS API enables REST Service implementation

Java EE Application Server logic _(WebLogic)_
"Java EE applications are actually deployed to a server in order to execute. While Java Standard Edition applications can run from the command line, Java EE applications have to be deployed to a server like WebLogic or WebSphere, JBoss, or Tomcat. These types of servers or containers host Java EE applications. They provide support for enterprise Java Bean, which implement reusable logic and web containers. Here, for example, we see the web container supporting front-end components like servlets, Java Server Pages, and Java Server Faces. And the EJB container supports business logic and back-end components."
