## Overview 

- Title and Objectives 
Welcome from the Lecturer 
To become familiar as to why Java was invented 
The structure of a java program 
Explore the java design mindset 
Common Java API's 
The use of java in the enterprise 

- Java Origins and Ecosystem
A member os C-like family 
Designed for consumer electronics 
Phones to super computers 

Ecosystem: Java Card, ME micro- Eition, SE Standard edition, MP Micro-Profile, EE Enterprise-Edition.

Cross-platform: Java program only needs to be written and compiled once 
No platform-specific changes has to be applied to the source code. 
A single, compiled version of a program can run on any platform. ie. MAC to Windows 
Java programs are executed within a java virtual machine (JVM)


- Java Language 

Code structure: 
Class: - basic units of code - describe data and logic of your program 
Package: - Intermediate logical code aggregation - Group of classes 
Module: - High-level physical code aggregation - Groups of packages

Java syntax - Java code is grouped into classes , classes contain methods and variables that fulfill their purpose 

Exception handeling - interrupt normal program execution when problems occur, decide what your program should do in case of an error 


- Java Design 
Classes: attributes and behavior  
Objects: an instance - a specific eg of a class 

Recuing code through inheritence - inherit(reuse) attributes and behaviors across the hierarchy., top-level classes contain generic code reused by their decendants 

"Java has other ways to achieve a flexible design, like interfaces that abstract out common behavior across classes, enumerations, called enums, for creating user-defined constants, and generics to pass specific type information to the compiler, making programs more stable and less error-prone."

Analysis, Design, and Architecture 
UML - Unified modelling language 
Analyze business requirements 
Model code structure 
Describe application deployment 

- Java API's 
Java Arrays and collections 
An array is a simple group of elements, the collection API provides more flexible capabilities for managing group of objects
